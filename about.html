            <p>My love for wine comes from a long standing family tradition of wine making. From a young age, I was involved in helping my grandparents with all aspects of wine making: Choosing the grapes, crushing, fermenting, pressing, aging, bottling and of course tasting the final product. Today, I continue this tradition and look for ways to incorporate new wine making techniques in the process. In addition to that, I love to share reviews of the wines I've been drinking to help others in their wine selection. </p>
